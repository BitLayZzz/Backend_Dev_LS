PROBLEM

description: Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century.
The return value should be a string that begins with the century number,
and ends with st, nd, rd, or th as appropriate for that number.

New centuries begin in years that end with 01. So, the years 1901-2000 comprise
the 20th century.

Things to consider: How would find a solution for all possible dates
- must be a math problem
- how would you handle suffixes for similar numbers (ex: 101st, 1st, 11th)
- convert string of century to array maybe? or Just read chars?


EXAMPLES
century(2000) == '20th'
century(5) == '1st'
century(10103) == 102nd'
century(11201) == '113th'


DATA
- arrays
- strings
- ints


ALGORITHM
CALL century method and pass variable YEAR into it as an int
ADD 100 from YEAR and save as CENTURY
CONVERT CENTURY from int to string
CONVER CENTURY from string to array
REMOVE last to indices from array CENTURY
INITIALIZE conditional statement
IF value of last index in CENTURY is 1 AND value second to last is NOT 1
   then append 'st' to end of CENTURY
ELSEIF value of last index in CENTURY is 2 AND value in second to last is NOT 1
   then append 'nd' to end of CENTURY
ELSEIF value of last index in CENTURY is 3 AND value in second to last is NOT 1
   then append 'rd' to end of CENTURY
END
CONCAT array CENTURY to string
RETURN CENTURY
