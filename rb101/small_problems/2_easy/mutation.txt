array1 = %w(Moe Larry Curly Shemp Harpo Chico Groucho Zeppo)
array2 = []
array1.each { |value| array2 << value }
array1.each { |value| value.upcase! if value.start_with?('C', 'S') }
puts array2

The code above will output:
Moe
Larry
Curly
Shemp
Harpo
Chico
Groucho
Zeppo

Original Answer:
This happens because array2 is a variable assigned an array object with a completely new memory address, When values are added to array2 in array1.each, the values are being copied to the new array in a different address space, thus not referencing the original array object.

Wrong! Answer :/

The correct answer is
Moe
Larry
CURLY
SHEMP
Harpo
CHICO
Groucho
Zeppo

It turns out `<<` is actually an operation that passes by reference, and thus makes variable copies that also reference the original string object in the same memory space.
