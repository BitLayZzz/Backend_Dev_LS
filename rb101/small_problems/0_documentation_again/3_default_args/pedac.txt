Description:
Consider the following method and a call to that method

def my_method(a, b = 2, c = 3, d)
  p [a, b, c, d]
end

my_method(4, 5, 6)

Use the ruby documentation to determine what this code will print.


--------------
Undestanding Problem
--------------
  - We have created method, that takes 4 parameter, calls p on an array of the parameters, and returns the value given.
  - 2 of the arguments, b and c, have default values
  - Only 3 arguments are passed to the created method.
  - do b and c keep their default values in this case?
  - will an error be raised because d is the last parameter needed?

------------
Example Cases
------------
given above.

---------------
Data Structures
---------------
 - In this problem we have a method, integers, and an array of those integers,
 - we call p instead of puts on the array of integers

------------
Algorithm
------------
 - Here we are using the default positions argument, algorithm for method parameters
