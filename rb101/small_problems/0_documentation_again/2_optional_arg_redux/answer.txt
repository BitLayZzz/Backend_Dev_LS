Task: Assume the following code

require 'date'
puts Date.civil
puts Date.civil(2016)
puts Date.civil(2016, 5)
puts Date.civil(2016, 5, 13)

What will each of the 4 puts statements print

Answer: 
According to the Ruby 2.7.2 documentation for the class method Date::civil, this method will output the same result as the Date::new, which follows the format, new([year=-4712[, month-1[, mday=1[, start=Date::ITALY]]]])

Thus, the code will output the following.

puts Date.civil
=> #<Date: -4712-01-01 ...>

puts Date.civil(2016)
=> #<Date: 2016-01-01 ...>

puts Date.civil(2016, 5)
=> #<Date: 2016-05-01 ...>

puts Date.civil(2016, 5, 13)
=> #<Date: 2016-05-13 ...>


-- LS Solution notes--
The documentation for the Date class can be found in the standard library API documentaton. It's not the easiest documentation to use, but for this particular problem, it's easy to look up the civil method.

Note that the brackets are nested with this method; items inside the outermost bracket pairs can only be omitted if all of the innermost bracket pairs are omitted as well. Hence, if you omit the month argument, you must omit mday and start, but the year, must be supplied. new
