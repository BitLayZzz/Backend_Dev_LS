This document contains the answers and descriptions to Lesson 3 section Hard 1


Answer 1: truthiness
The code will return nil because, in ruby, a local variable is initialized,
even if it's within a conditional that doesn't get executed.


Answer 2: Object mutation
The final answer will be the hash {a: 'hi there'} because although the overall
hash object was not changed in memory, the string value contained under the key
a was mutated by the reference variable informal_greeting.

Answer 3: Driving home variable scope
code group A will return
'one is: one'
'two is: two'
three is: three'

code group B will return
'one is: one'
'two is: two'
'three is: three'

code group C will return
'one is: two'
'two is: three'
'three is: one'
