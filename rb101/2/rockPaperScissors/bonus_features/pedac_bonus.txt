This is a PEDAC guide for adding bonus features on the previous
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game!

PROBLEM
--------
Descriptions: Expand the original Rock Paper Scissors game to include Lizard
and Spock. Typing the full word is tiring. Update the program so the user can type
"r" for rock, "p" for paper, etc. (I added a number system instead so each options has it's own number option). Lastly, create a score tracking system to determine a winner. Whomever reaches five total wins, wins the over all game.

Modified rules:
Rock crushes lizard or scissors,
Paper disproves Spock or covers rock
Scissors decapitate Lizard or cuts paper,
Lizard eats paper or poisons spock.
Spock vaporizes rock or crushes scissors,

Things to consider?
Can player quit at anytime?
What happens on tie rounds?
What happens when user enters in the wrong number?
What happens if PC chooses paper and User Chooses Lizard?

EXAMPLES
--------
: 1 -> You chose rock | PC chose paper, PC wins this round: Usr 0 | PC 1
: 4 -> You chose Lizard | PC chose paper, It's a Tie! Usr 0 | PC 1
: 3 -> You Chose Scissors | PC chose spock, PC wins this round: Usr 0 | PC 2
: 5 -> You chose Spock | PC chose scissors, You win this round: Usr 1 | PC 2
...
: 5 -> You chose spock | PC chose rock, You've Won! Usr 5 | PC 2, Play again?
: -1 -> Quitting...goodbye for now!


DATA STRUCTURES
---------------
- Numbers (ints)
- Strings
- Methods
- Arrays and Ruby Hashes


ALGORITHM
----------
- assign numbers to each choice
 -> 1: rock, 2: paper, 3: scissors, 4: lizard, 5: spock, -1: quit game
- initalize main loop
 - initialize round assigned with 1
 - initalize game loop (until player1 on or player2 reaches 5 wins, continue)
  -> initialize user_score
  -> initialize pc_score
  -> output round
  -> request user input, (-1, 1-5)
  -> assign number between 1 & 5 to computer
  -> send game to duel (3) parameters each player
  -> if result of duel is You won!, increment usr_score by 1
  -> if result of duel is I won!, increment pc_score by 1
  -> if usr_score equals 5, declare usr winner and break
  -> else if pc_score equals 5, declare pc winner and break
  -> else, increment round by 1


3 Duel Method

 initialize result
 - call round_winner? method w/ parameters usr, pc
  -> if true, usr won this round,
  -> assign usr to result
 - call round_winner? method w/ parameters pc, usr
  -> if true, pc won this round
  -> assign pc to result
 - if neither are true, declare the round a tie
  -> assign tie to result
