Data Structures
--------------------
- global variable for welcome sign
- local variables
- numbers for user input
- an array of options for PC choice

ALGORITHM
--------------------
Implementation in ruby:
0. Welcome Sign
1. Start loop till break is called
2. Take user input as either as an int
  i. user input = 'nil' or " " output 'You didn't Choose!'
  ii. elsif user input is not 1, 2, or 3, output 'That's not an option!'
3. save user choice accordingly
  i.   if 1, user choice equals rock
  ii.  if 2, user choice equals paper
  iii. if 3 user choice equals scissors
4. assign PC input random number from 1 to 3
5. save pc choice accordingly
  i.   if 1, pc choice equals rock
  ii.  if 2, pc choice equals paper
  iii. if 3 pc choice equals scissors
6. compare user choice to pc choice
 i.     usr equals rock, pc equals rock, output 'It's a Tie!'
 ii.    usr equals scissors, pc equals rock, output 'I Win!'
 iii.   usr equals paper, pc equals rock, output 'You Win'
 iv.    usr equals paper, pc equals paper, output 'It's a Tie!'
 v.     usr equals scissors, pc equals paper, output 'You Win!'
 vi.    usr equals rock, pc equals paper, output 'I Win'
 vii.   usr equals scissors, pc equals scissors, output 'It's a Tie!'
 viii.  usr equals rock, pc equals scissors, output 'I Win!'
 ix.    usr equals paper, pc equals scissors, output 'You Win'
