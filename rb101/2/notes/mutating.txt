This is a quick list of Ruby Methods that mutate og objects

- Indexd Assignment is mutating
  --> a[2] = 'x'
- Concactenation is Mutating
  --> a = 'hello', a.concat(!) or a << '!'
- Setter methods are mutating
  -- person.name = 'Bill'
- Methods with '!' are mutating
  -- a = [1, 1, 2], a.uniq!

Of course...there are exceptions
