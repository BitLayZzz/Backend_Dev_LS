Description:
Build a command line calculator program that does the following:
- asks for two numbers
- asks for the type of operation to perform: add, subtract, multiply, or divide
- displays the result

-------------------------
Understanding the Problem:
-------------------------
  - input1: a number (ex: 1)
  - input2: type of arithmetic operation to perform ('+', -, *, /) 
  - input3: another number (ex: 2)

  - output: the result of the arithmetic operation (ex: 1 + 2 = 3)

  - requirements: 
    - user input for numbers must be of type float or integer
    - no more than two numbers
    - the arithmetic symbol will be given 

  - problem model:

  - things to consider:
    - Will the program continue after the operation is completed?
    - How will other data types be handled if given by user?
    - What if negative numbers are given?

------------------------
Examples / Test Cases:
------------------------
  - input1: 1
  - input2: '+'
  - input3: 2
  - expected output: "1 plus 2 equals 3"

  - input1: 2.56
  - input2: '-'
  - input3: 2
  - expected output: "2.56 minus 2 equals 0.56"

  - input1: one hundred
  - input2: '*'
  - input3: -22
  - expected output: retries at input1

  - input1: 1
  - input2: 'divided by'
  - input3: 2
  - expected output: retries at input2 

------------------------
Data Structure:
------------------------
  - input: 
    - two numbers (floats/integers), and a arithmetic operator in type string
    
  - rules:
    - arithmetic calculation with the three inputs 
    
------------------------
Algorithm:
------------------------
  - create a loop to begin program with title screen
    - unless the program returns 'q', keep the program looping
    - ask user for a number in the form of a decimal number
      - if the user input is 'q', change the user input equal to q and end
      - if the user gives a string other than q, start the program over
    - ask the user for an operator
      - if the user input does not equal +, -, *, /, or q retry asking 
      - quit the program if user chose 'q'
    - ask user for a second number in the form of a decimal number
      - if the user input is 'q', change the user input equal to q and end
      - if the user gives a string other than q, retry asking 
    - do arithmetic operation depending on the operator given
      - if '+', find the sum
      - if '-', find the difference
      - if '*', find the product
      - if '/', find the quotient
    - output the result
  - if "q" was given at any point, end the loop
