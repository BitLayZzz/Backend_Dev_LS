# Assignment:
Do a few practice rounds using pseudo_code to guide your problem solving logic.

For example, write out pseudo-code that does the following:

1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
2  a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all of those strings concatenated together.
3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element


Algorithm 1:
- DEFINE a method named addition that takes to numbers.
  - within the method addition, perform arithmetic on the two numbers.
  - RETURN the sum of the two numbers
- CALL the method addition and pass two numbers to it
- PRINT the returned value to the screen

Algorithm 2:
- CREATE a method named cat, that takes a list as a paramter
  - CREATE a variable named concatedlist
  - LOOP through the list
    - convert each value to type string 
    - push each value in the index to the end of the variable concatedlist 
    - RETURN the variable concatedlist
- GET a user sentence 
- CONVERT that user input into a list of words/characters, separated depending where spaces were in the sentence. 
- send the newly made list of words to the method cat and save it to finalresult
- PRINT finalresult

Algorithm 3:
- DEFINE a method named even-index that takes a list of integers as a parameter
  - CREATE a new array named even_filter
  - LOOP through the list of integers
    - if the value in the array is from index 0 or an even index, push it to even_array 
  - RETURN even_array
- GET a user list of integers
- CALL the method even_filter with the user list of integers as the parameter
- SAVE the returned value to a variable called finalresult
- PRINT finalresult
