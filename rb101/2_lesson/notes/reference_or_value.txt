This section of the course discusses the differences between
"pass by reference" and "pass by value"

Started 12/18/2021

- This programming topic stems from there being two ways of dealing objects passed to methods
- You either have "references" to the og object, or "values" (copies) of the og object.

So what is pass by "value"?
- In C, for example, passing an object by value creates a copy of the og object.
- Copies have no effect on the original object outside of the method.
- Ruby is up for debate
  --> some say it's pass by value, because re-assigning the object doesn't affect outerscope.
  --> methods require an implicit or explicit return to re-assign outerscope variables

Now what is pass by "reference"?
- Passing by reference allows method operations to make changes to original objects.
- Ruby can also be "pass by reference", because methods mutate original objects.
  --> ex: the difference between 'str.capitalize' and 'str.capitalize!'

So What's Going On Here?!
- Some Rubyists call this behavior "passing by value of the reference", or "call by sharing"
- Most important thing: 
 --> When an operation within the method mutates the caller, it will affect the og object
- Whether or a not an object is mutated by method operations depends on the operation used...
  --> In other words, practice a lot and you will notice which ones do and which ones don't!
  --> ex: array = array + [name] is very different than array = array << [name]. Try it out!

So in Summary...

- Pass by Value uses object copies, Pass by Reference uses og objects, and Ruby uses both! 
- So Ruby is a "Pass by Value of the Reference" language!
