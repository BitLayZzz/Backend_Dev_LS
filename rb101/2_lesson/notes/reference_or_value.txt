This section of the course discusses the differences between
"pass by reference" and "pass by value"

Started 12/18/2021

- This programming topic stems from there being two ways of dealing objects passed to methods
- You either have "references" to the og object, or "values" (copies) of the og object.

So what is pass by "value"?
- In C, for example, passing an object by value creates a copy of the og object.
- Copies have no effect on the original object outside of the method.
- Ruby is up for debate
  --> some say it's pass by value, because re-assigning the object doesn't affect outerscope.
  --> methods require an implicit or explicit return to re-assign outerscope variables

-------------------------------------------

Now what is pass by "reference"?
