2. Write a method in pseudo-code that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

START

# given an array of strings called "string_arr"

SET iterator == 0
SET sentence = an empty string

WHILE iterator <= size of string_arr
  SET sentence += string_arr at space iterator

READ sentence

END
