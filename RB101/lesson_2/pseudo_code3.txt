3. Write a method in pseudo-code that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element.

START

# given an array of integers called "numbers"

SET iterator = 0
SET evens_only = an empty array

WHILE iterator <= size of numbers
  evens_only == READ numbers at space iterator to end of evens_only
  iterator + 2

END
